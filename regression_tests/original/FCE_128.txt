Well , I have rather modern parents , so they do n't prohibit me to go to the discoes or somewhere with my friends .
The only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day .
I hope it was interesting for you to know about the rules in my life .
Look forward to hearing from you ,
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I was to Circle Theatre to watch ' Over the rainbow ' musical show , recently .
I was trully dissapointed by it .
My expectations were high after I 've read your leaflet in which it was advertised as ' London 's newest and best musical show ' .
Now , I can assure you it was n't .
Firstly , it was Danny Brook who was supposed to star .
The substitute was far worse .
Secondly , I had to wait fourty - five minutes before the show finally began .
Another unkept promise are the discounts .
There were n't any !
Lastly , when I got hungry after the delay it appeared that the theatre restaurant is closed . You can believe me it was n't ' my perfect evening out ' and I have no other choice than asking to give my money back .
I paid for something I did n't get so it is obvious that I want my money back .
I got the £ 15 ticket .
I 'd like you to send the money to this adress ; ul Taklowa 10

Yours sincerely ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
After two days the whole school knew .
When Paul entered the school gate , other children began to tease him and laugh .
Paul could n't stand it .
He ran out quickly , leaving everyone behind .
He felt very ashamed and did n't know what to do .
Normally , he would go and talk to Pat but Pat betrayed him .
They were no longer friends . '
How could he , ' Paul thought ' Now the whole school knows Jean attracts me ' .
As he was sitting there , he heard someone walking towards him .
He turned around and saw ... Jean . '
What are you dong here , why are n't you at school ? '
she asked .
Paul was like paralyzed .
He could n't reply . '
I had heard what you 've said about me ' , she said , I think it 's sweet ' .
Paul could n't believe his ears .
While he was thinking how to reply , Jean took his hand and led him to the school .
When they entered everyone became silent .
All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat is n't that bad at all .

Dear Helen Ryan

About the activities while at the Camp I would like to enjoy swimming , not because I am good in it , just because I keen on and the other one is Photography .
As I never did this in whole my life could you tell me if we have to do our own meals or I can find everything ready to eat there ?

Dear friend
Kim
Last month , I enjoyed to help at a pop concert in Portugal .
Everything were new for me .
I had to ( lyd ) tidy up the place where they have to wait until their turn .
The group asked me make sure that in the fridge they always could find a big variety of drinks including honey and lemon for throat .
Other thing I had to do is keep an eye in the towels , I mean , dried towels because as you know that country is too hot , especially for my liking , as they have to change the clothes and looks fresh ; do n't ask me why .
The pop concert happened in a big stadium called " Mararcanã " .
I just did not enjoyed when they were making the instruments work for the big day .
But what I particularly liked was see and ask autographs from the rest of the others groups .
Do n't be jealous , I will make a copy for you , OK ?
Love
Dear Ms Jane Clark .
I am writing to you with regard to the International Art Festival that was held recently .
The festival was excenent in many ways , and especially it being an international festival was a challenging , but brilliant idea .
I assume that this fact attracted people very much .
In addition to that , organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good .
I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with proper price to come to the festival .
Moreover , most of the events I went to were fantastic .
However , I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year .
The festival was supposed to be an international one , but the artists and stars participated in it were from six countries only .
Thus , I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited .
Also , some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences .
I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls .
Furthermore , I found that there were not many genres of neither the films nor the plays .
So I suggest you have various kinds , and more numbers of plays and films next year .
I hope that next year 's festival will be much more successful that this year 's one .
Yours sincerely ,
The Old Man and the Sea
People all have different opinions about books .
Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones .
But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway 's " The Old Man and the Sea ' .
Above all , realistic stories teach me something of the life , or at least influence me .
As far as I 'm concerned , my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book .
Here , the fishman is very old , but he is still challenging to everything he faces .
When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship , he never gave up taking it back to his village , even when sharks were around him .
Real stories have huge impacts on me , and affect me a lot , often in good ways .
In addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive , I personally do n't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they can not be true .
But , while reading realistic stories , I just fall deep into the story , into the writer 's own world .
Ernest Hemingway 's sentences are precise , but still very powerful and alive .
So when I read other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
Realistic stories thus , develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .
We all learn from reading books , but realistic stories have more influence on me and develop my personality .
That 's why I prefer realistic stories to unusual ones .

Dear Sir ,
I would like to complain about a musical show .
I was very disappointing a week holiday for me because I had got a lot of problem with the show .
I had seen the advertisement that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it was not Danny Brook .
I was really disappointing because he is my famous actor .
The musical should started at 19.30 , but it started at 20.15 .
When I went to asked for the discount of ticket in the cashier desk they told me no discount available for this .
I had seen the advertisement say that discount available .
After the show I decide to had dinner in your theatre restaurant , but I could n't because it closed .
It closed at 10 pm but the show finished at 10.30 pm .
This was not perfect evening for me , so if you do n't give my money back , I will tell to the newspaper about it .
I am looking forward to hear a good new .
Yours sincerely ,
Boo Sersuwan .
I think in the next 100 years people will wear the space clothes with small engine in the back . because of the atmosphere .
The atmosphere in the earth now starting badly every years .
The carbon dioxide are growing very fast and people cut more trees , therefore not enough trees to such carbon dioxide and produce oxygen .
The designer will have a lot of idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars , ships , planes and space ships .
This mean the engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it , so it must useful in the future .
I think somebody will make a very big area to grow plant because they can sell the oxygen .
This is a new business .
I think I can win this price , because this clothe will produce in the future soon .
