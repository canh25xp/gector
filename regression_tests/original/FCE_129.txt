SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30 , AND I GOT HEAVILY MAD WHEN I LOOK MY WATCH AND NOTICE THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 ( FORTY ) MINUTES AND THE SHOW DIDN'T START YET ... I MEAN I WAS AMAIZING !
THEN I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT , DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE , AND I DIDN'T GOT ANY DISCOUNTS WHEN I ASKED FOR THEM .
AFTER THE SHOW I GOT OUT THE SHOW ROOM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED AND WENT TO THE RESTAURANT TO DRINK SOMETHING TO RELAX , AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ?
.. IT WAS CLOSED !
I COULDN'T BELIVE IT HOW THIS CLASS OF THEATRE CAN BE SO ..
OH I'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I'AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE LAST THING , IT WAS THE HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER GOT SO I DEMEND FOR MY MONEY BACK !
I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS .
MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECT ME IN SEVERAL WAYS , I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZES ; MORE CONFORTNESSCOMFORTABLE WE GET .
NOW WITH MODERN MACHINES I CAN MAKE A BETTER USE OF MY TIME , IF I'AM LATE TO GO TO TRAINING AND I HADN'T IT YET I JUST TAKE MY FOOD AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVEOVEN .
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE COMPUTERS , I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINE IN THE WORLD , YOU CAN LIVE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT , BY JUST USING THE INTERNET , IT HAS ALSO HELPED ME IN MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK , I MEAN IT 'S INCREDIBLE THE TIME YOU WAIST BY MAKING THING WITHOUT A COMPUTER .
BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PACIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE ,
THIS CAN BE BAD TO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BE CONFORTABLE WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORKS I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THEM .

Dear Ms Ryan ,
I am writing to reply your letter and I am so glad to win the prize .
Thank you very much !
In answer your questions : I would like to travel in July .
I am a full - time student , my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather 's farm in August .
So July is the only time I will be free .
Secondly , I would prefer tents to log cabins .
Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping .
Therefore , I am afraid I ca n't get used to log cabins easily .
Besides camping , I also like painting .
My Dad is an amateur painter , and I have begun painting for 8 years .
I 'm good at portraits and landscapes .
I would also like to play golf during my holiday , but I have never played it before , will I get any tuition ?
Finally , I should like to ask some questions .
How is the weather like in California in July ?
What kind of clothes should I pack ?
If I want to buy some gifts , how much money should I take and can I use traveller 's cheques in every place ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Shopping is not always enjoyable
Our lives are getting better and better , so people began to go shopping more frequently .
It 's always a great job to go home with bags of purchases , but is it doing us good apart from the temporary satisfaction ?
Everyone likes sale , but those so - called sale items are not really of value .
In fashion industry , sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time , because those owners want to make room for new stock .
But you 'll find your ' cool bargain ' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones .
Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit .
Therefore , we become impulsive buyers easily under these tricks .
The result , we feel guilty after spending more than we 've estimated , or even suffer from financial difficulty .
Shopping does not just effect us mentally , but also physically .
It 's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping .
Think of the awful crowds , the busy car parks , polluted air in the city centres and mile - long queues in front of the cash desks .
I do n't think anyone would really like to face them .
But once you get there , they 're just inevitable , are n't they ?
Well , now before you go shopping , think again and you 'll find out it wo n't be always enjoyable .
Dear Manager ,
I 'm a person , went to see the musical show , I would like to know something about " Over the rainbow " programme ?
You have informed the actor , times , discount and the restaurant to people , but actually what did you do ?
The first , you have changed the actor .
The second , the time is late from 19.30 , it started 20.15 .
The third , the tickets have not the discount .
The last , after show , I could n't go to the restaurant , because it was closed .
What 's happened ?
This is the good theatre do , or not ?
This is the famous theatre .
You know , What did people feel ?
Everybody attented go to the show , funny , and happ in the end , and what have we go then ?
Disapponted !
Thank about that .
If you can not managed the programe , why did you informe people before programe start ?
I tought you inderstood ' ; please send money back to me , you know why , do n't answer me ?
Thank you ,
Now we know , our world have developed to new world , becase we have high technology to do .
If we came back to the past , we felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have plane and done by ourself and last time .
In the present , the teachnology is a past of life .
It started from got up in the morning , we have the machine help us to cook , iron , cleanning , washing , and then we went out to work , there are car , sky train to travel for help us convenience and quickly .
While we worked at the office , there are the computer and equipment for help to work and easy , after we have finished work , we come back home , there are television for get information , news , data by different way and quickly .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
We appreciated the mordern technology changed my daily life for help every easy and quickly , we have time to do many things .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Regarding the programme you have organised , it is great ideas everything that you have planed , but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement .
It is good start to go on sightseeing by bus on Monday morning , we can se all famous buildings in a few hours .
It 's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river .
The idea about going to science museum is fantastic , I read about the museum , it is really interesting in science history .
After all morning in the Museum , it is wonderful and on tuesday doing some shops , whereas the student have another idea for tuesday .
On Wednesday after viseted national Art Gallery , we can have a chat about ours next holiday at the free time in the afternoon .
The advertisement that students saw is about a fashion show , but to go to the show you will need cancel the tour on tuesday and add the show , because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00 .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Freedom !
Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and television is private life of famous people .
It is really interesting how people like knowing famous people life .
Without someone famous know , photographs take pictures secretly , try to get money on it .
Sometimes being famous can get stress , everywhere they go there are people around them , especially journalists , trying to ask millions questions .
Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want , but it is quite difficult to do thing in a public places , because nobody like famous politicians or film stars without asking questions .
On the whole , to be rich and famous do n't always bring happeness , whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous .
Dear Sir or Madam
I am writing to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow " which was performed in your theatre two weeks ago .
I went to see it on 5th June 2000 .
First of all that evening there was not Danny Brook but an unknown and not very good actor .
Secondly the show started 45 minutes late .
Then at the tickets - office I was said that no discounts were available so I had to pay the full prize despite I am a student .
Finally I would have had dinner at the theatre restaurant if it had not been already closed because the show finished , obviously , late .
I am really not satisfied with the show - organization particularly because in the advertisement you wrote something different .
For this reason I expect to receive my money back .
Yours faithfully
Unfortunately , Pat was n't good at keeping secret .
Last week we had another demostration of this .
On Monday we decided to organize a surprise - party for Ted 's birthday on Tuesday evening .
Each of us had a different task .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , Heather and I went to buy the present ; Pat said : " OK I 'll phone to some of Ted 's friends to invite them " .
Obviously Ted should have known nothing about it and we remembered it to Pat twice : " the party is a secret ! ! " and she said : " Yes , it must be a surprise ! "
On Tuesday afternoon we met to prepare the last details ; Pat said : " I 've just phoned to Tommy , Billy and Alison and I met Ted yesterday evening : they all have said ok for the party .. "
In that moment she understood that something was wrong !
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Thank you for organising good programme , especially like sightseeing from River trip to Greenwich in London for three days .
I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give the information of ' The London Fashion And Leisure Show ' which we would like to go and to huggest our opinion .
We have seen an advertisement of last Saturday ' The Times ' edition of the show .
It will be held in Central Exhibition Hall , London or Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 .
Firstly , it will introduce latest fashions connecting Millenium .
Secondly , we will be able to see leisure and sports wear about fashion trend of next year .
It would be fantastic opportunity to the students who study a fashion .
Finally , we can see how to make up and make better hairstyle in the show .
Most of all , It is free for students to enter .
We would like to know if it is possible to change your programme .
We would be grateful if we could go there in the afternoon on 14 March because we are able to go shopping .
We look forward to hearing from you .
Yours Sincerely ,
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Whenever I recollet it , I feel self - confident .
When I was twenty years old , I had to go to Army .
As you know , my country has been separated into two countries ( South and North Korea ) .
However , instead of going to Army , I was able to apply to Korea Auxiliary Police .
One year later , I was working in Kang - nam police station in Seoul .
Suddenly , the theft signal came into .
So , another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly .
When we arrived at the place which it happened , one man started running away .
