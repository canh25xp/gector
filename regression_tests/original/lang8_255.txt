Manga in English
I think that Manga is the great entertainment culture from Japan .
My favorite writers are Naoki Urasawa ( The Monster , 20st century boy and more ) and Hiroya Oku ( Gantz ) .
By the way , I found some web sites that there are huge amount of Mangas that translated in English .
( I think no doubt about illegal . )
It 's a new experience and very educational of English .
But , I think that there are a lot of difficult expressions in Mangas in English .
Diagnosed of being easily impressed
Today , I was reviewing my previous entries and my comments .
I realized that I 'm that kind of people who are easily impressed .
I find lots of things fascinating .
I 'm moved by very simple things and other people might not even have a second look at .
For instance , I started watching Indian movies about a month ago .
I have some friends who are crazy about this genre .
I , on the other hand , did n't have much time to watch any .
When I had the time , I brought about six Indian movies to watch .
The first movie I watched , made me cry for two hours like a five year old who lost her doll .
You think the second one was different ?
Not at all .
The six movies have the same basic idea .
Actually all the Indian movies have the same basic idea .
However , I continued crying during the rest five and each one of them impressed me even more .
Indian movies are like clay that you can shape into many different shapes but they 're all still made of clay .
The shape is what impresses me , and not the clay itself .
This concept might be a bit ambiguous for those who have n't been in such situation .
So , how bad is it ?
Still . . .
I still have got a cold .
I took a medicine , so I feel better for now .
sorry , that 's all for today .
Have a nice day : )

The first Man in Rome
I am going to talk about the historical novel called `` The First Man in Rome `` by Colleen McCullough , who is a british woman writter .
The novel is about a important roman politican called Caius Marius .
He is de main character , although appearing others like Cornelius Silla , Metelus , and the Caesar 's grandfather .
Marius did n't come from a important family , but he became in consul because he was a clever and popular general at roman army .
So , after he was chose consul by the romans , he went to Afrika where he fought againt Yugurta who was king of Numidia .
Marius won the war in two years , and when he went back to Rome he was chose consul again during five years .
Marius had to fright other tribes at north of Italy , until in 100 B .
C .

An abstract concept of hapiness
Although most people think about what happiness is like , most people never doubt there are happiness somewhere in human 's life .
A famous man , I heard , said in the past that the worst things for you is to be born in the world .
According to this , human 's life can be said to be leisure time to the end .
Do you think there are like happiness in reality ? ?
Please correct these sentences !
Sorry for a little academic .
I am just writing about the parents ' attitude when their children complain about chronic abdominal pain .
Is the below one OK ?

Let me introduce myself
Hello everyone ,
I 'm Makitys .
This is my nickname .
I was born and grew up in Tokyo .
I studied applied physics and electronics at a university in Tokyo .
I took a bachelor 's degree of these subjects at the university .
After graduated from the university , I got a job as an engineer .
I changed jobs a few times but the same type of job as an engineer .
I still work for an electronics maker in Japan as an engineer .
I 'm a single woman and live by myself .
My parents and a brother and a sister live in Tokyo .
I moved to Fukuoka from Yokohama for business this January .
Fukuoka is located the northern part of Kyushu .
Kyushe is a part of the Japanese Archipelago .
( see the map I 've attached )
Fukuoka city is the biggest city in Kyushu .
Comparing with Tokyo , Fukuoka is compact but it is a very comfortable city .
Commodity prices here are lower than those in Tokyo and Fukuoka Airport is very near central Fukuoka .
You know , Narita Airport is far from central Tokyo .
It takes one hour from the airport to central Tokyo even if you take an expensive superexpress .
Moreover Tokyo is a very crowded city .
One thing I unsatisfy to live here is that I 'm separated from my family .
It takes much money to go see my parents from here .
I miss my family and relatives who live in Tokyo .
If you come to Fukuoka , please let me know !
English lesson for Halloween
I 'm an elementary school teacher as you might know .
In Japan , starting next year we 'll officially have to teach English to students who are in both 5th grade and 6th grade .
I 've made some English classes , actually .
Yesterday , I made an English lesson with ALT , which is an acronym for Assistant Language Teacher .
The lesson 's topic was Halloween .
We provided some kinds activities to get the students not only to keep enjoying the lesson but also to keep some vocabulary in mind before they know it .
One of them is `` Halloween trivias and Bingo `` .
The student need to answer some questions about Halloween I 've prepared by playing Bingo .
The more correctly they answer , the more Bingo they can get .
After the class , I asked the students to answer a questionnaire .
I was very glad to find they liked the lesson .
One of my ultimate goal as an English teacher is that all students look the world broadly .
I 'm sure you 'll have plenty of opportunities not only to communicate people from other countries but also to know several cultural differences through the lesson .
I believe this will lead them to accepting more things .
That 's why I 'm very excited with teaching studens English ! !
[ Diary ] 14 / 8 / 10 of Event
It is cloudy or rainy recently .
Although my school was no lecture , I got up early in the morning today .
I ate a piece of toast putting butter and cinnamon sugar and went to a coin laundry near my house to wash my clothes because I do not have clothes washer in my house .
It cost six dollars to washing and cost six dollars to the dryer .
When I washing ended , it was evening .
I went to the cake shop in the city my friend introduced to me as nice taste and famous .
The shop of inner decorating was green .
After came back home , I cooked dinner , and the dinner was prawn & avocado salad , roast chicken and OTAMA SAN GOHAN .
First , cut lettuce , cut coarsely a tomato and then stair - fly some prawns .
Stair - fry it until it became golden brown .
The roast chicken only heated up with oven .
The OTAMA SAN GOHAN is Japaneseonly traditional food .
It only sprinkles the raw egg and a pinch of the soy source on warm rice .
They were easy cooking but they tasted nice ! !
After that I watched two movie , animation of genius boy and 007 , on TV for approximately four hour .
So I felt tired my eyes and butt .
Thank you ( The letter to my daughter 's English teacher )
My 4 - years - old daughter goes to an English lesson since when we decided to move to Singapore for 3 months .
She is interested in speaking English and writing alphabets now thanks to the teacher .
This is the letter below .
I appreciate to teach English to my daughter .
She was always looking forward to your lesson .
Your lessons were energetic and so much fun .
When we decided her to go to a international school that only few Japanese go to , we noticed she had to start to study English immediately because she could n't speak English at all .
I was looking for English class around here .
At first we found a flyer at the play room .
We thought just taking a trial lesson , but she told me that I want to go to the lesson again .
I am very surprised to her progress .
Now she is very interested in speaking English , writing alphabets and sings WHAT ' S YOUR NAME ?
song everyday .
Her progress owe to you .
What your children speaking only English are same class is also good for her .
It will be base after she will go to new school .
If I did n't need to take care of my kids , I wanted to have your lessons !
When you come to Singapore , please contact us .
It is very easy to come with kids because it is clean , safe , just a 1 - hour time difference and available Haneda airport .
We are looking forward to seeing you and your children someday somewhere .
Thank you very much .
Thank you for all the staff and class mates .
Take care .
Best regard .
Basaballgame
Hello .
Yesterday I went to the stadium to see the baseball game .
After classes of university , I went back home directly , prepared packages and searched what time I should leave home and which trains I should take .
I went there with my friends .
The team I cheer is located in second position .
And if the team win 8 games , the team will get first position .
But remainder of its games is 9 games .
Therefore it is so difficult for it to get first position .
The game began .
The starting pithier was not good , so that the opposition could get 3 points easily .
But in this attack they could n't get any points .
So in this game we lost .
We cheered very hard , but the miracle was never happened .
So today I have a sore throat .
That 's about it for today .
See you again / /
My hobbies
I have some hobbies .
Those are playing sports , reading a book , lithening to music , taking a walk and so on .
My favorit hobby is talking with my friends , because I think it is the best time to be with my friends .
I gained about 10 kilograms after I quitted my clubs in high school .
That 's why I have to lose my weight ! ! !
So , I jog and exercise always .
I wanna have the six - pack ! ! haha
Holidays
This weekend three holidays in Japan .
Saturday , Sunday and Monday close .
Monday is Equinox 's day
It will gradually be warm .
Japanese are waiting cherry blossoms in this season .
What might be some of the causes of over - weight or obesity in the US ?
Last English lesson , we discussed it .
There are some of causes , such as high calorie food , laziness . . .
In Japan , there are a lot of fast food restaurants around town . convenience store too . we can easily get food . same circumstance in the U .
S . but most Japanese people are not obese .
A teacher asked it `` why `` .
that is probably a result of lack of self control to eating .
I go to study English on Sundays .
Sometimes I ca n't explain what I thought and I ca n't come up with good idea thinking in English .
But , the moment I just touched the door knob at my home , I got my answer .
`` School lunch `` and `` Education of dietary `` could be good effect of self control to eating .
All of public primary school provide lunch for students .
That was wonderful system .
The nutritionist organized calorie control , a variety of menu every day , providing best season 's food , traditional meal .
Through school lunch , students learn many kind of taste , knowledge of food and Japanese culture for six years at least .
once every three time a day though , It makes good habit and health .
How about my opinion ?
a lot of workload
