And I want to live my life on my own pace .
Sleeping as long as I want everyday .
But I found it hard to achieve recently .
Because when I finished my classes , homeworks or jobs etc . . .
It 's nearly 10 pm when I back home .
And after I take a bath , brush my teeth , chat with my friends etc . . .
It 's nearlly 12 pm .
Afterall , I want to at least healthly sleep before 12 pm .

tears . . . . .
These days I suffered many unhappy things .
Maybe those matters were not so bad as the facts , but I really could 't handle them while they occured together . . . .
English is one of my biggest problems .
I do n't know how to master this language well . . .
Though I spend most of my time and energy in learning English , it seems that I hardly make any improvement has become a truth . . .
I do n't know why I have to learn English so hard . . ! ! !
Today , . .
I went to take the business English correspondence class as usual . . but this time . . .
our teacher said a sentence to me , which made me heart broken . .
I had never knew my English was poor until the teacher told me that my English was sound illogically . . . .
I did n't know how I felt at that moment . .
but I did know my eyes were wet . .
and the tears nearly fell from my face . .

I 'm going to study abroad in America .
I 've received the acceptance letter and scholarship decision from the Berklee College of Music .
I 'll enter the Berklee in the fall semester this year .
But I have two worries .

Another is high - priced tuition .

The Berklee do n't requires a TOEFL score .
I 'm just attending the Institute to improve my English because I 'll have to take many classes in English .
Many assignments are given to me everyday .

Irregular heartbeat
Several days ago , I got an irregular heartbeat for the first time in my life !
It was like this ; I suddenly started to feel a kind of discomfort around my heart .
Then I checked my pulse and found that there was a missing beat at intervals .
I was very scary because I had been very healthy so far .
I thought , `` It 's so terrible !
I 'm still in the 20 's .
Do I have to get along with it all my life ? ``
Then I went to the hospital and took an ECG .
The doctor told me that I did have a irregular pulse ossacionally but it was not a fatal one .
He added that it could get worse due to stress and fatigue , and he just advised me to take an enough rest .
I was releaved to hear the doctor 's diagnosis but I 'm still worried .
I did n't know that stress could induce an irregular heartbeat of a healthy young lady like me !
As the old saying goes , all illness comes from the mind .
How to write a reseach proposal ?
I think that may be a common question for those students want to pursue a higher education .
We seldom research something .
What Chinese universities offer for their students are mostly composed by coursework base curriculum .
The show of our lives must go on , so does the application .
I 've sum up some points which I think important and useful .
1 .
You can count on google as your best friend , adviser and an almost infinite resources of academic papers .
Many of them you can download pdf copy , or If you ca n't download paper from the links scholar . google . com offer you , go directly to the author 's website , many authors enjoy their paper to be seemed and cited by potential readers .
2 .
A good review is the best start point .
And then you can trace the author , or the paper cited to do a more in depth research in your interested area .
3 .
The balance of width and depth of your reading is essential .
Both way have its merits and disadvantages .
4 .
Inovative and original idea is good , but if you can not find them , you should know that most of research work is just refinement of other 's work .
A practical plan and reasonable analysis is also worth a lot .
Vessel
I 'll spend the next weeks on board of the `` Justo Sierra `` vessel making some geophysical research and learning .
I 'm sure it 's going to be a terrific experience .
Bad thing , I have n't learned the vessel 's parts in English yet .
I need to study !
Please correct my English sentences ! ( 20090108 )
The thing that I want to make in January 2009 is to invest more effort in studying English and keep on writing sentences in English every day here , Lang - 8 !
Thanks a lot !
USJ
