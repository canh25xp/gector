Good luck on your new start !
My teacher is going to move to change his job .
He is a nice guy and taught me English very kindly and was willing to accept my getting off the track .
And he took in my favorite subject , like soccer .
Actually , who let me know about Lang - 8 was him .
He is also good at Japanese and studies ' Kanji ' .
His Kanji ability is much better than mine .
We 've known each other for only half a year , but his lesson was a lot of fun .
I 'm going to miss him but I really wish him the best of luck with his new life .
I 'm looking forward to seeing him again here .
