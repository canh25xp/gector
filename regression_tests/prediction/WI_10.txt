My town is a medium sized city with eighty thousand inhabitants .
It has a high - density population because of its small territory .
Despite it being an industrial city , there are many shops and department stores .
I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the center of the city which is surrounded by a park .
Pasteries are very common and most of them offer a special dessert from the city .
There is a special zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kinds of establishments : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , groceries , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .
Most of the shops have sales and offers at least three months of the year : January , June and August .
The quality of the products and services are quite good , because there is a huge competition . However , I suggest you are careful about some fakes or cheats .
Everyone has his own plans .
People want to be a doctor , others want to be a teacher .
